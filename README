Config/Vars version 0.01
========================

Config::Vars makes it easier to declare and initialize configuration
variables in a central perl module.  Without Config::Vars, you have to
list each variable name three times in order for it to be usable from
every module in your program.  You have to list it on a "use vars" or
"our" declaration, you have to add it to @EXPORT or @EXPORT_OK, and
you have to initalize the variable.

With Config::Vars, instead of:

    use strict;
    package MyVars;
    use Exporter;
    use vars qw(@ISA @EXPORT_OK $foo @bar %fred);
    @ISA = qw(Exporter);
    @EXPORT_OK = qw($foo @bar %fred);

    $foo  = 42;
    @bar  = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    %fred = map {$_=>1} @bar;

You can do:

    use strict;
    package MyVars;
    use Config::Vars;

    var $foo  = 7;
    var @bar  = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    var %fred = map {$_=>1} @bar;

@ISA, "use Exporter", @EXPORT_OK, and "use vars" are all taken care of
for you.  Note that your module must still end with a true value.


DEVELOPMENT STATE

Config::Vars is a brand new module.  It has a decent test suite, but
it hasn't been used much in the Real World yet.  Thus it should be
considered "beta" software.  If six months pass without any bugs being
reported, or any features being added, I'll bump the version to 1.0.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, do the standard Perl module four-step:

   perl Makefile.PL    or    perl Makefile.pl LIB='my/install/path'
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:
